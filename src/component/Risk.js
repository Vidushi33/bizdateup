                  <p className="text-muted f-17 mt-3">
                  Investments in startups/early-stage ventures (“Companies”) bear an inherent risk of not assuring full-fledged profits or returns from the investments, since these companies may not have a business model or established concept which can be used as a reference for 100% success. It is for this reason that it is generally recommended to create a diversified portfolio of investments, which will have the potential to deliver gains and absorb capital losses in the aggregate.

                  <p className="text-muted f-17 mt-3">
                  Liquidity refers to equity shares that can be sold with ease. However, equity investments in the Companies are highly illiquid as the shares of such Companies are unlisted/private and cannot be sold easily on an exchange or similar secondary trading platform. </p>

                  The Companies may most likely be unable to pay any dividend throughout the life cycle of an investment. Therefore, in order for you to earn a return out of any of your investments, you will have to go through a further sale or such other similar process for which a time frame cannot be ascertained.  </p>

                  The Companies may raise additional capital in the future and therefore, your shareholding may be diluted, as a result of such issue of new shares.  </p>
